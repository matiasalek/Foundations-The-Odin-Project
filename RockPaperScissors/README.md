# Rock Paper Scissors Project from The Odin Project

This project is about making a browser console rock paper and scissors game. If you want to play, create a .html file and copy index.html content into it, same for mainRPS.js. After that just open index.html in your daily browser and open the console, usually with F12.

# Project finished

The project is now finished as 14/01/2021. Game is fully functional, code could use better practices for a better readability. Also I'd like in a future to make the game not console only, so you can play in the browser without opening the console, but for now, the game is 100% working on console.
