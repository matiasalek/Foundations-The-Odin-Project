# Foundations - The Odin Project

**Basic knowledge and introduction to web dev from The Odin Project.**

In the Foundations introduction course from The Odin Project I learn about the basic web dev tools, like Git foundamentals, text editos and IDE, basic command line, HTML, CSS and Javascript basics, frontend and backend concepts.
I practice the basics from HTML and CSS with freecodecamp and the basics from Javascript with some easy projects such as Rock, paper and scissors, calculator, etc.
